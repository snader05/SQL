#In this SQL, I'm querying a database with various tables in it to quantify statistics about customer and order data.

#1- How many orders were placed in January?

SELECT count(orderID)
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE orderID <> 'Order ID'
AND length(orderID) = 6; 

#2- How many of those orders were for an iPhone?

SELECT count(orderid)
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE product = 'iPhone'
AND orderID <> 'Order ID'
AND length(orderID) = 6; 

#3- Select the customer account numbers for all the orders that were placed in February. 

SELECT distinct acctnum
FROM BIT_DB.customers cust
INNER JOIN BIT_DB.FebSales Feb
ON cust.order_ID = Feb.orderID
WHERE orderID <> 'Order ID'
AND length(orderID) = 6; 

#4- Which product was the cheapest one sold in January, and what was the price?

SELECT distinct product, price
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
ORDER BY price ASC limit 1; 

#5- What is the total revenue for each product sold in January?

SELECT sum(quantity)*price as revenue, product
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
GROUP BY product; 

#6- Which products were sold in February at 548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101, how many of each were sold, and what was the total revenue?

SELECT sum(quantity), product, sum(quantity)*price as revenue
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales
WHERE location = '548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101'
GROUP BY product; 

#7- How many customers ordered more than 2 products at a time in February, and what was the average amount spent for those customers? 

SELECT count(distinct(cust.acctnum)), avg(quantity*price)
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales Feb
LEFT JOIN BIT_DB.Customers cust
ON Feb.orderID = cust.order_ID
WHERE Feb.quantity > 2
AND orderid <> 'Order ID'
AND length(orderID) = 6; 

#8- List all the products sold in Los Angeles in February, and include how many of each were sold.

SELECT product, sum(quantity)
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales
WHERE location like '%Los Angeles%'
GROUP BY product;
